# Lessbian - Less Debian

Yet another "new version". Not working yet. You can use the previous one thet can be found at [v2 link](https://github.com/romandobra/lessbian/tree/v2)

The power of Debian. Nothing more. Less Debian - LESSBIAN.
Gnome desktop, live boot. No bloatware. Fresh drivers.

## Motivation:

I wanted a Linux system that:

- can install all the recent software, but
- has as few preinstalled software as possible
- can easily boot from USB
- can boot to the RAM.

Enjoy and ...
